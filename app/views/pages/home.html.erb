<p>Perpetuate is a heavy metal band hailing from Windsor, Ontario. Guitarists Jamie Hush and Chris Rafinski join forces with drummer Mike Wiznuk and Calvin Love on bass to deliver hard-hitting, high-energy tunes reminiscent metal's golden age. The band is fronted by keyboardist Kim McInnis, whose voice weaves beauty and aggression into soaring soprano melodies over a roaring symphony of guitars. With classical inspiration and strong influences in modern metal and progressive music, Perpetuate is seeking the perfect balance of technicality and clarity in song-writing.</p>

<p>Perpetuate has been fortunate to share the stage with some of Ontario’s favourite metal and hard rock acts, including Baptized in Blood, Hail the Villain, Today I Caught the Plague, and the legendary Anvil.</p>

<p>In November 2010, Perpetuate entered the studio to record their debut CD with Glenn Fricker at Spectre Sound. The album features five original tracks and a guest appearance by Betrayer’s Jeff Klingbeil, who lends his voice to an unforgettable cover of “The Trooper” by Iron Maiden. The self-titled CD was released in April 2011 and is now available from CDN Records and digital music retailers everywhere.</p>

<p>Eager to bring their music to new fans, Perpetuate is looking forward to traveling across Ontario in promotion of the album. With ambitions of touring nationally and overseas, Perpetuate has a mind to win over audiences everywhere and take their place among the greats of Canadian metal.</p>
